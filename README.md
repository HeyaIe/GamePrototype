# GamePrototype
 This is a basic project that I created utilizing Unity fundamentals

## Index
- Player movement
- Player input
- Scene transitioning
- UI
- NavMesh
- Colliders

### Player movement
Used a NavMesh agent to move target to location.

### Player input
Involving both mouse and key inputs to progress through the game.

### Scene transitioning
Implemented a Unity timeline that transitions from the opening scene to the main scene.

### UI
Display messages in the opening scene and instructions upon entering a targetted area.

### NavMesh
Baked a NavMesh for the NavMesh agent to walk on.

### Colliders
Placed a collider for UI detection.
